## General Information
This project examines COVID-19 statistics from the United States through an interactive dashboard. Data is visualized in a choropleth map to view states with the high death toll from COVID, allowing the user to click on a state for more information. Additionally, COVID dashboards created to view deaths by age and filtered by state as well as comparative graphs using COVID and Influenza data from 2020-2022.

## Conclusions and Considerations for Further Analysis
Our work seeks to provide insights into the spread of COVID-19 across age groups, gender, and location in the United States. Analysis of the death rate pre/post vaccine roll out, comparing US data to world data, and potential for machine learning models to predict COVID death risk based on an individual's demographics are all areas for potential exploration.
